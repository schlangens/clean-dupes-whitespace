# About
The script will now take the input from "input.txt," remove duplicates and whitespace, and save the cleaned data to "output.txt" filtering on prefix "HCA." It will also create another file called "output2.txt" and save the cleaned data without filtering on HCA and place each entry on each line. 

# Quick start
- ``python -m venv hca``
- ``hca\Scripts\activate``
 - ``pip install <package_name>``
- ``python <python.py>``
- ``deactivate``
